Entropy : Measure of Uncertinity(or Randomness or Impurity). value range = [0,1]

InformationGain = Entopy before Spliting - Entropy After Stliting

The feature give you the highest information gain should be selected for the root node.

Ginni Index :

Depth of decision tree = measure of complexity of decision tree

* Every ML Model has
  1. Trainable Parameter :
  2. Hyper parameter : Depth of the decision tree is a hyper parameter
* Hyper parameter tunning
* Lost Function - SSE based , SAE based
