#### Linear Regration

Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to predict a continuous numerical value by fitting a straight line between input (X) and output(Y).

**FORMULA:**  Y=MX+C
Y Predicted output
X = Input variable (feature)
m = Slope (kitni steep line hai)
c = Intercept (line Y-axis ko kaha cut karti hai)

* Positive Linear Relation
* Negative Linear Relation

**Types**

1. Simple Linear Regration
2. Multiple Linear Regration
