* **Supervise Learning :** When we have labeled data then we use supervise learning.

  * **Regression :** Regression is a machine learning task where the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value based on input features. The output is a real number (Contineous values).

    * Real number output : Infinite (uncountable).
    * **Examples** :

      * Predicting house prices based on size, location, and number of bedrooms.
      * Forecasting sales revenue for a company.
      * Estimating a personâ€™s age from biometric data.
  * **Classification** : Classification is a machine learning task where the goal is to predict the category or class label of a data point based on its features. The output is discrete (categorical).

    * Descrete output : countable values.
    * **Examples** :

      * Predicting whether an email is spam or not spam (binary classification).
      * Classifying an image as a dog, cat, or bird (multi-class classification).
      * Determining if a patient has a disease (e.g., positive or negative).
